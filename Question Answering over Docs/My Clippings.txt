Principles allow you to solve problems, even those you may have never encountered before, in a way that a recipe or mechanical procedure cannot. If you really understand the principles of physics, for instance, you can solve a new problem simply by working backward.

The Market Engagement Hypothesis identifies your key belief or assumption about how the market will engage with your idea. Will they want to learn more about it, explore it, try it, adopt it, buy it? And if they adopt it, try it, or buy it, how are they going to use it and how often? Will they buy it again or recommend it to friends? In other words, the MEH articulates your vision of how the market will respond to and use your idea.

Furthermore, prototypes and pretotypes serve different functions. Prototypes are primarily designed to test if an idea for a product or service can be built, how it should be built, how (and if) it will work, what’s the best size or shape for it, and so on. Pretotypes, on the other hand, are designed primarily to validate, quickly and cheaply, if an idea is worth pursuing and building in the first place—a different objective that is best accomplished with a different set of techniques and best served by having its own vocabulary.

As you can see, we will be using all three sets of tools (thinking tools, pretotyping tools, analysis tools): Describe the original BusU idea. Identify BusU’s Market Engagement Hypothesis (MEH). Write BusU’s MEH in XYZ Hypothesis format. Hypozoom into xyz hypotheses we can test quickly. Identify a set of pretotyping experiments we can use to validate our hypotheses. Tactically prioritize experiments based on Distance to Data (DTD), Hours to Data (HTD), and Dollars to Data ($TD). Run the first set of experiments. Based on an objective analysis of the YODA from the experiments, determine the next steps.

Good strategy almost always looks this simple and obvious and does not take a thick deck of PowerPoint slides to explain. It does not pop out of some “strategic management” tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or fill-in-the-blanks scheme. Instead, a talented leader identifies the one or two critical issues in the situation—the pivot points that can multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.

Bad strategy tends to skip over pesky details such as problems. It ignores the power of choice and focus, trying instead to accommodate a multitude of conflicting demands and interests. Like a quarterback whose only advice to teammates is “Let’s win,” bad strategy covers up its failure to guide by embracing the language of broad goals, ambition, vision, and values. Each of these elements is, of course, an important part of human life. But, by themselves, they are not substitutes for the hard work of strategy.

A good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the kernel. The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. The guiding policy specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis. It is like a signpost, marking the direction forward but not defining the details of the trip. Coherent actions are feasible coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.

Bad strategy, I explained, is not the same thing as no strategy or strategy that fails rather than succeeds. Rather, it is an identifiable way of thinking and writing about strategy that has, unfortunately, been gaining ground. Bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy or action. It assumes that goals are all you need. It puts forward strategic objectives that are incoherent and, sometimes, totally impracticable. It uses high-sounding words and phrases to hide these failings.

A good strategy defines a critical challenge. What is more, it builds a bridge between that challenge and action, between desire and immediate objectives that lie within grasp. Thus, the objectives a good strategy sets should stand a good chance of being accomplished, given existing resources and competence.

A leader may successfully identify the key challenge and propose an overall approach to dealing with the challenge. But if the consequent strategic objectives are blue sky, not much has been achieved. The purpose of good strategy is to offer a potentially achievable way of surmounting a key challenge. If the leader’s strategic objectives are just as difficult to accomplish as the original challenge, there has been little value added by the strategy.

When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons for the underperformance. Unless leadership offers a theory of why things haven’t worked in the past, or why the challenge is difficult, it is hard to generate good strategy.

An important duty of any leader is to absorb a large part of that complexity and ambiguity, passing on to the organization a simpler problem—one that is solvable. Many leaders fail badly at this responsibility, announcing ambitious goals without resolving a good chunk of ambiguity about the specific obstacles to be overcome. To take responsibility is more than a willingness to accept the blame. It is setting proximate objectives and handing the organization a problem it can actually solve.

A design-type strategy is an adroit configuration of resources and actions that yields an advantage in a challenging situation. Given a set bundle of resources, the greater the competitive challenge, the greater the need for the clever, tight integration of resources and actions. Given a set level of challenge, higher-quality resources lessen the need for the tight integration of resources and actions.

To guide your own thinking in strategy work, you must cultivate three essential skills or habits.

Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs. It can cause us to make premature decisions. It can hamper us in negotiations, leading us to reveal more than we should as we scramble to fill the silence, unable to bear the uncertainty of not knowing what the other person is thinking. And most important, it can lead us to feel anxious

There may be times when you need to be charismatic toward someone you resent. As you can imagine, resentment is a very uncharismatic mental state that causes high negativity both in your mind and in your body language. In addition, it’s your body that suffers the consequences of carrying around this negativity. To quote one of my favorite adages: “Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.”

Let’s say that you’re about to discuss a difficult issue with someone who intimidates you.

One good way to avoid creating this anxiety is to keep eye contact for three full seconds at the end of your interaction with someone. This may sound short, but it’ll actually feel endless! If you can get into the habit of doing this, you’ll find it well worth the effort. With just a few seconds’ investment, people will feel you have truly paid attention to them.

When one person feels disrespected, manipulated, taken advantage of, or disregarded, tension or conflict will usually be the result.

In our marriage and our work, we’ve learned that somatic awareness takes center stage as a necessity to generate both trust and alignment. Somatic awareness is the experience of being in and being aware of our bodies. It’s the perception and internal experience of living in our bodies and noticing how we feel physically as we emotionally experience situations and interact with others.

Bob’s standard practice for facilitating meetings is to start off with a personal question: What has your attention? What are you looking forward to? Just asking the question creates an environment in which people will share something important to them and will allow others to develop empathy or at least awareness of how others are feeling. This, remember, is an essential component of psychological safety.

Challenge yourself to be complete. The conversation is most successful when there’s a slight feeling of danger. “Should I be saying this?” “Is this too much?” “Am I being too revealing?” All of these are reasonable responses to vulnerability—and also signs that you’re probably getting somewhere good.

Now there are undoubtedly other elements to story — a turning point, climax, denouement, and more — but character, goal, and challenge are the three legs of the stool. Without these three, you don’t have a story.

As I said, there are lots of different ways to structure a story beyond character, goal, and challenge. In fact, I just outlined one of those ways (and will return to it in Chapter 13): normal state, inciting incident, turning point, conflict, resolution.

Creating a story involves these basic steps: Determine who you are trying to reach (your audience) and find out as much as you can about them. Figure out what you want them to do — buy your product, work more efficiently, follow you into proverbial battle. That’s the goal. Think through the challenges that may get in the way of that goal — lack of budget, outdated technology, distrust. Find a character who has overcome that challenge — by appealing to value over price, working around technology, discovering common ground. Make sure there’s a resolution to your story.

It’s not enough for you to understand your own goal; you have to understand what your audience wants, too. Because if your story doesn’t address their needs and interests, it’s not going to resonate with them.

But deep down we are creatures of emotion. We’re driven by feelings of fear or vanity or security. It’s often said that people buy on emotion and justify with logic — facts and data are used to shore up and defend what we’ve already decided in our hearts.

Similarly, every story we tell must have a goal. And every single detail must support that goal. If it doesn’t, it should be cut. You may have a fascinating fact or amusing aside, but “interesting for the sake of interesting” is not good enough. Your purpose is not simply to amuse, but to change beliefs and behavior.

When we barge in with the answer or think we can do it better, or when we think they should know better, we reinforce their shame.

Brent Gleeson, a leadership coach and Navy SEAL combat veteran, writes, “Organizational culture comes about in one of two ways. It’s either decisively defined, nurtured and protected from the inception of the organization; or—more typically—it comes about haphazardly as a collective sum of the beliefs, experiences and behaviors of those on the team. Either way, you will have a culture. For better or worse.”

In the 2016 shareholder letter, even though he wasn’t explicitly talking about two-pizza teams, Jeff suggested that “most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.”5

Jeff has an uncanny ability to read a narrative and consistently arrive at insights that no one else did, even though we were all reading the same narrative. After one meeting, I asked him how he was able to do that. He responded with a simple and useful tip that I have not forgotten: he assumes each sentence he reads is wrong until he can prove otherwise. He’s challenging the content of the sentence, not the motive of the writer. Jeff, by the way, was usually among the last to finish reading.
